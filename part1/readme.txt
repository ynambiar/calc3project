LU Factorization
File to run: lu_driver.m

Execution syntax: lu_driver('Filename.dat')
lu_driver reads an input file of an n x n matrix or an n x n+1 matrix
Argument: Name of the respective matrix file

If the matrix is n x n:
  Uses lu_fact to factorize the matrix.
  Prints out the L, U matrices and error to the window.

If the matrix is n x n+1:
  Determines b vector by truncating the last column of input matrix.
  Redefines A matrix.
  Uses the solve_lu_b to solve for x using the new matrices.
  Prints out the L, U matrices, error, x solution, and solution error to the window.
  
  
QR Factorization
File to run: qr_driver.m

Execution syntax: qr_driver('Filename.dat')
qr_driver reads an input file of an n x n matrix or an n x n+1 matrix
Argument: Name of the respective matrix file

After reading file, prompts user input for solution method: Householder or Givens.

If the matrix is n x n:
  Uses qr_fact to factorize the matrix with the respective method.
  Prints out the Q, R matrices and error to the window.

If the matrix is n x n+1:
  Determines b vector by truncating the last column of input matrix.
  Redefines A matrix.
  Uses the solve_qr_b to solve for x using the new matrices and the respective method.
  Prints out the Q, R matrices, error, x solution, and solution error to the window.
  
  
Hilbert Matrices
File to run: hilbertSolver.m

Execution syntax: hilbertSolver(num)
hilbertSolver will create and solve matrices up to the size of the input value
Argument: The n value of the largest n x n hilbert matrix to be solved **Must be greater than 1**

Creates a file called 'hilbertResults.txt'.

Solves the Hilbert Matrices generated by hilbertMaker.
Prints to the file results in the following format:
    n Results

    Xsol: *The transposed Solution Vector*

    LU Results:
    Error: *The LU Decomposition Error*
    Solution Error: *The LU Decomposition solution error*

    Householder Results:
    Error: *The Householder Decomposition Error*
    Solution Error: *The Householder Decomposition solution error*

    Givens Results:
    Error: *The Givens Decomposition Error*
    Solution Error: *The Givens Decomposition solution error*
