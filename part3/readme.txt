For part 3 of the project, you will need to call the function power_method.m. This function will have two outputs, the first is the largest eigen value and the second is the number of iterations it took to converge below a tolerance 1/10000000. You will have to input two .dat files. The first inputted file must be a matrix of numbers seperated by spaces. The second must be a vector of numbers with each number on a separate line. The matrix MUST be square, and the vector MUST have mathing dimensions.

Example matrix:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Example vector:

1
1
1
